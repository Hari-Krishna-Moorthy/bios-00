# Day 3

Today the training starts with the blog post showcase.
Then we have showcased our line project then we have 
corrected the faults that were done and in between 
we saw the concept like `move slow to move fast`, 
where it means that we can move slow there is no 
fault in that, because there must be no errors 
when we move slow, which consumes more time in 
future when debug occurs.

Then we discussed the function to calculate distance. 
Then we talk about oops concept of `encapsulation and 
abstraction`. We discussed `Tell Donâ€™t ask` - Tell 
what is supposed to do rather asking.

Then we discussed what is `BDD` and `META programming` in ruby.
Then we discussed some conditions which need to be 
satisfied, then only we can say it is equal. 
We saw how to override equals.

Then we started doing a new problem statement 
(`rectangle perimeter`) in ruby, and we had some 
discussions on workflow of ruby project and working 
of some files.

My feedback maybe we can start slow in ruby as 
syntax were not standard like java, need to 
learn some ruby code tricks.
