# Day 2

The work on this day was same like previous day ,
we showcased our blog post.I showcase my blog. 
But this day git commands got memorized and previous
day also checked `rspec` as I already installed ruby.
Then today code cycle gone in the same way, and we learn 
some lessons and rectified some mistakes,

We saw about Top to bottom approach and bottom to top 
approach,bike shedding, 
`YAGMI - You canâ€™t gonna Mean It`, 
then `RED-GREEN-COMMIT` FLOW. 

Then we discussed that based on resource available, 
based on requirements, based on cost of project 
at present, we should do project.
After lunch, we did some type racing, and we 
collaboratively did that project discussing the 
names type of spec to include,then we 
did pair programming but with some extra time, 
our team presented first we almost did the 
projected with the rules that were stated, and we 
learn some things from the mistakes and what to do and 
what not to do
